# L1: Important Biological Molecules

Important molecules in living things:

DNA; Ribosomes; Water; Glucose; Glycogen; Proteins; Amino acids; Carbohydrates; Lipids; Enzymes

**Biological Molecule**: a group of chemicals found in a living organism

All biological molecules, except water, are carbon based

### Hydrogen Bonds

Form when a slightly positively charged part of a molecule meets a slightly negatively charged part of another molecule. 

**Polar Molecule**: a molecule with an uneven distribution of charge

‼ The individual strength of a hydrogen bond is weak, but in large numbers, they provide strength

**Macromolecule**: large molecules; example: protein, carbohydrates, ...

Monomer: lots of small, identical molecules

Polymer: a long chain of monomers

Monosaccharide (eg. glucose, etc...)   ⇒polymerisation⇒   carbohydrate

Amino acids   ⇒polymerisation⇒   proteins

### Condensation Reactions and Hydrolysis

**Condensation Reaction**: forming a large molecule, by joining together monomers (releasing water)

**Hydrolysis**: breaking down molecules by adding water

**Metabolism**: the sum of all chemical processes taking place in a living organism

### Carbohydrates and Monosaccharides

**Monosaccharide**: monomers of carbohydrates

Elements of carbohydrates:

- Carbo - Carbon
- Hydrate - Water
- Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen

Three forms of carbohydrates:

- monosaccharide
- disaccharide
- polysaccharide

How carbohydrates are made up:

1. Monomers are small individual molecules, making up polymers
2. Carbon atoms in monomers join to form long chains
3. Polymers: long chains of repeating units

‼Most biological molecules are made up of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen: C, H, O, and N

### Monosaccharides

Monosaccaride ⇒ single sugars

⇒ general formula: $(CH_2O)_n$    $_n$- any number between 3 and 7

⇒ white, crystalline solids - dissolve in water to form a sweet tasting solution

**Glucose**

⇒ hexose sugar (6 carbons)

atoms have a ring shape

Drawing an α-glucose structure:

1. hexagon - around and up
2. ADDUD - α-glucose, down, down, up, down (direction of OH groups)
3. add hydrogens to 4 bonds per carbon

For β-glucose, use the abbreviation: BUDUD: β-glucose, up, down, up, down

The hydroxide group in carbon atom 1 changes place with the hydrogen bonded to carbon 1
