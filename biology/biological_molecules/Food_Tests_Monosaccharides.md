# L2: Food Tests, Monosaccharides



## Examples of Monosaccharides:

- Glucose - alpha- and beta-
- Fructose
- Galactose
- Ribose - Found in DNA and RNA

## Food Tests - Reducing Sugars

Reducing sugars:

↳ all are monosaccharides

↳ reduction is a chemical reaction, in which electrons are gained

electrons are gained from Benedict's reagent, in the Benedict's test

Benedict's test for reducing sugars:

The reagent: called Benedict's reagent, an alkaline solution of copper sulfate

Tests for reducing sugars: all monosaccharides, maltose, lactose

Method:

1. Add 2cm^3 of the sample to a test tube, to test (sample must be in liquid form, so needs to be homogenised in water)
2. Add 2cm^3 of the Benedict's reagent to the sample
3. Heat the sample for about 5 minutes, in gently boiling water

Results:

**Negative**: blue

**Positive** (from low to high concentration): green, yellow, brown, orange, brick-red

Copper oxide is produced when the Benedict's reagent reacts with a reducing sugar. This creates the red colour in the solution. 

## Carbohydrates - Disaccharides and Polysaccharides

‼ Disaccharide - formed when 2 monosaccharides join together

‼ Polysaccharide - formed when many (more than 2) monosaccharides join together

Examples of disaccharides:

- Maltose
- Sucrose
- Lactose

Maltose:     α-glucose + α-glucose ⇒ maltose + water



Maltose - do not abbreviate the $CH_2OH$  part at the top of the diagram. 

The hydroxide group from Carbon atom 1 on the left had side, and the hydrogen from the hydroxide group on Carbon atom 4, are used to form the water molecule. The oxygen molecule forms a glycosidic bond between the two molecules, bonding them together into a maltose molecule.

To get the α-glucose back, add water (hydrolysis). This breaks the glycosidic bond
